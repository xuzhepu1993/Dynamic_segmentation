# Dynamic_segmentation
This two files are for kernel density estimation based dynamic segmentation for asphalt roads algorithm.
The first file extract_contour_classify.py is for Arcgis toolbox. It's available only after you add it into a self-defined toolbox.
The second file final_segment.m is for matlab.
For more information about the use of this two files and the dynamic segmentation process, please refer to the paper
